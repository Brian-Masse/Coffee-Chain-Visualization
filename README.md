# Coffee-Chain-Visualization

This project involves the creation of my *custom data visualization system*, and is split into a few parts that tackle different areas of the project, as looking at taking on the whole thing was a bit outside the scope of one project!

1. [PART I:](https://github.com/Brian-Masse/Coffee-Chain-Visualization/tree/main/PART%20I) Introducing the module, and demonstrating its limited capabilities
2. [PART 2:](https://github.com/Brian-Masse/Coffee-Chain-Visualization/tree/main/PART%20II) Rotational display, more modularity, and customization
