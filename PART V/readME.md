# PART IV

For this visualization, ```Relationships: Correlation``` I investigated my system’s ability to make meaningful connections with other visualizations. Specifically, because it currently lacks the ability to render multiple series next to eachother, I wondered how can I make it easy for a reader to look at the trends from one visualization and compare them to those of another. To accomplish this, I implemented something I had both been dreading and excited for: **Another Visualization Type**. For this project particularly, I went for an area chart, such that I could overlay it with the point distributions I had previously been making to hopefully summarize and compare trends better. 

And, after I endured endless minor data formatting problems, positional misalignments, and a million untraceable exceptions, I can confidently say: This was a *major* pain in the ass!

However, the insights I gained for how to effectively add new visualizations (and specifically those that can handle x, y, and a series) are incredibly valuable, and hopefully legible in my mess of comments. This final product is one that I am incredibly proud of, and I feel much more confident about coffee’s ability to successfully grow into new. I hope that I can continue to develop these visualizations, and refine the back end systems that makes their rendering possible!

Similar to last project, I would still like to modularize some components, and add much *much* more customization to all the chart properties to make more unique and potentially valuable charts! This should be a more relaxing task than the one that I endured today, so I plan to take that on next project, as a sort of recovery!

(Also for those wondering how this relates to the visualization theme: there are two graphs? You can look at the trends presented by the area lines and make correlations? I think thats good enough :) )
