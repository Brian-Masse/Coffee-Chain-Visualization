For this final visualization, ```relationships: space``` I took a more literal approach to the word space: and made the pallett space themed. Although this might not have been my best application of the prompt, it enabled me to work on a super important, but often overlooked (or at least, poorly integrated) component of all data visualizations modules: **customization** 

In this project, I made classes out of text, lines, and axis perimeters. This enables a user, for each individual area of the graph, to change any perimeter they like, while also being able to define a commons style for an entire graph. This required some changes to the way data is rendered, and how customization is handled, but in the end it enables a wider breadth of easily customized visualizations, which is always better. In this render, I try to showcase as many of the options that a user has at their disposal, but I know I missed a few (specifically, different point types and overriding color)

As I come to the end of this term, and this class, this project, and specifically where coffee is currently, is a great place to end. Thinking back to the start of the term, and being frustrated with the impossibility of specifying colors in seaborn, I feel that I have learned lots from the data visualization landscape, and have now used that knowledge to solve the problems I encountered within it! I am very proud of the current state of coffee, and my understanding and contributions to the data visualization field, and I am super excited to continue growing both this module, and my skills in this subject!
